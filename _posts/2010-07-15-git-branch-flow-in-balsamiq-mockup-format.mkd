## Introduction 
If you are playing with git branch, then [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/git-model) is must read, and the comments in his blog is also quite valuable, it saves me lots of time.

Most people are inspired by his model picture, unfortunately it is written in keynotes (Mac OS), I canâ€™t reuse it, since I am [balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) fans, I write it in 1 hour, see result

The source files are submit into github, and wait Vincent to approve and merge back to orig repo (http://github.com/nvie/gitflow), currently it locates under my forked repo. see [source gitflow.bmml](http://github.com/larrycai/gitflow/blob/develop/contrib/gitflow.bmml)
