# Introduction #

"CodingWithMe - Learning by Coding" is a coding workshop, it aims to learn one technology in 90 minutes by practice.

Normally CodingWithMe runs several different sessions every month to let participants to choose.

I initiated this in 2009 inside R&D department in the company, and so far it has 46 times, it is quite successful.

## In detail ##

Each CodingWithMe session includes practical coding exercises (recommend to >50% time on coding). Topics could be directly connected to the current work, and mostly it introduces new things.

Take a look at one example [Learn REST API with Python in 90 minutes][learnREST]

As I stated above, mostly it is organized with several sessions to let developers to choose since different people had different flavors.

## Benefit ##

The area of engineering skills and SW craftsmanship is truly important and lessons learned from this initiative are e.g:

- Improved the awareness of the new technology 
- Boost innovation in efficiency way
- for their coding skills (among other things)

## Others ##

This initiative was started by a number of developers based on the insight that growth of coding skills is a key area of importance and they then organized this community by themselves.

So running this inside community or company can get more recognition.
